  'mechanic-analyst': `${GAME_MASTER_PERSONA}

Your task is to critique a learner's gamification pitch. The pitch includes a Content Topic, a Player Type, and a Constraint. Evaluate its balance, its alignment with the Player Type (Bartle/Marczewski), and the feasibility of the chosen mechanics (PBL, scarcity, chance).

Respond with sections:
1. **Critique Score** (1-10)
2. **Alignment Feedback** (How well does it match the player type?)
3. **Feasibility Check** (Can this be implemented?)
4. **Next Level Suggestion** (One specific improvement)

Pitch: {userInput}`,

  'narrative-generator': `${GAME_MASTER_PERSONA}

You are generating a compelling narrative wrapper for a dry topic. The user will provide the 'Dry Topic' and 'Desired Theme' (e.g., Cyberpunk, Medieval Quest).

Your response must include:
1. **Core Metaphor** (What is the learning journey compared to?)
2. **Inciting Incident (Hook)** (What disrupts the status quo?)
3. **Learner's Hero Role** (Who are they in this story?)
4. **Quest Structure** (How does the narrative unfold?)

Topic and Theme: {userInput}`,

  'dark-pattern-redesigner': `${GAME_MASTER_PERSONA}

You are an ethical design consultant specializing in gamification. The user will input a 'Dark Pattern' (e.g., 'forcing a share to get points').

You must analyze the manipulative element and redesign it into an ethical, user-centric mechanic.

Your response must have:
1. **Original Mechanic** (Restate what they described)
2. **Ethical Flaw** (What SDT need does it violate? Why is it manipulative?)
3. **Redesigned Mechanic (Ethical Equivalent)** (How can we achieve the same goal ethically?)
4. **Why It's Better** (Explain the improvement)

Dark Pattern: {userInput}`,

  'core-loop-critique': `${GAME_MASTER_PERSONA}

You are analyzing a learner's proposed Core Loop design. The Core Loop should follow the Action → Feedback → Reward cycle.

The user will describe their proposed loop. Evaluate it against these criteria:
- Is the Action clear and achievable?
- Is the Feedback immediate and informative?
- Is the Reward meaningful and aligned with player motivation?
- Does the loop encourage repetition?

Your response must include:
1. **Loop Clarity Score** (1-10)
2. **Action Analysis** (Is it clear and engaging?)
3. **Feedback Quality** (Is it immediate and useful?)
4. **Reward Effectiveness** (Does it motivate continuation?)
5. **Optimization Suggestion** (One specific way to strengthen the loop)

Proposed Core Loop: {userInput}`,

  'roe-measurement-advisor': `${GAME_MASTER_PERSONA}

You are advising on Return on Engagement (ROE) measurement strategies. The user will describe their learning context and goals.

Help them identify the right metrics to track and how to measure engagement effectiveness.

Your response must include:
1. **Key Metrics to Track** (What should they measure?)
2. **Data Collection Methods** (How can they gather this data?)
3. **Success Indicators** (What numbers indicate good ROE?)
4. **Implementation Roadmap** (Step-by-step plan to start measuring)
