# AI Content Assistant - User Guide

## Overview
The AI Content Assistant helps you generate high-quality educational content for your courses using artificial intelligence. It's integrated directly into each block editor in the course builder.

## Accessing the AI Assistant

The AI Assistant appears automatically when you:
1. Add a new content block to a lesson
2. Edit an existing content block

You'll see a purple/blue gradient panel at the top with a sparkles icon (✨) and the text "AI Content Assistant".

## Using the AI Assistant

### Step 1: Choose Your Approach

**Option A: Use a Template**

2. **Use Context**: The AI considers your course title, module, and lesson context
3. **Iterate**: Use refinement options to improve the content
4. **Review**: Always review and edit AI-generated content before publishing
5. **Save Templates**: Save frequently used prompts as custom templates

## Generation History

Access your previous generations:

1. Click the "History" button in the AI Assistant panel

## Troubleshooting

### "You're offline" Message
