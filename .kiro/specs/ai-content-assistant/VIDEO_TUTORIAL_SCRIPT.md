## Tutorial 1: Getting Started with AI Content Assistant

**Duration**: 8 minutes
**Target Audience**: New admin users
**Prerequisites**: Admin access to course builder

### Script

**[00:00-00:30] Introduction**

> Hi! Welcome to the AI Content Assistant tutorial. I'm excited to show you how this powerful tool can help you create course content 60-80% faster while maintaining high quality.
>
> In this video, you'll learn how to access the AI Assistant, generate your first piece of content, and understand the basic workflow. Let's dive in!

**[00:30-01:30] Accessing the AI Assistant**

> First, let's see where to find the AI Assistant. I'm logged in as an admin and I'm in the Course Builder.
>
> [SCREEN: Navigate to Admin Course Builder]
>
> I'll open an existing course—let's use "Introduction to React"—and select a lesson. Now I'll add a new text block by clicking the plus button.
>
> [SCREEN: Click + button, select Text Block]
>
> Notice the "Generate with AI" button right here at the top of the editor. That's your gateway to AI-powered content creation. You can also use the keyboard shortcut Cmd+G or Ctrl+G to open it quickly.
>
> [SCREEN: Click "Generate with AI"]
>
> The AI Assistant panel expands, and we're ready to generate content!

**[01:30-03:00] Your First Generation**

> Let's generate a lesson introduction. I'll type a simple prompt: "Explain what React hooks are and why they're important."
>
> [SCREEN: Type prompt in text field]
>
> Before I generate, notice these options below the prompt:
> - Tone: I'll keep it conversational
> - Reading Level: College is appropriate for this course
> - Length: Moderate works well for an introduction
>
> [SCREEN: Show options]
>
> Now I'll click the Generate button and wait a few seconds.
>
> [SCREEN: Click Generate, show loading state]
>
> And there we go! In about 8 seconds, the AI has created a well-structured introduction to React hooks. Let's review what it generated.
>
> [SCREEN: Scroll through generated content]
>
> Notice how it includes a hook to grab attention, explains the concept clearly, and sets expectations for what learners will discover. This is a great starting point!


**[03:00-04:30] Reviewing and Editing**

> Now that we have generated content, we have several options. Let's look at the action buttons:
>
> [SCREEN: Highlight action buttons]
>
> - **Accept**: Inserts the content into your block
> - **Refine**: Improves the content with one-click options
> - **Regenerate**: Creates completely new content with the same prompt
> - **Edit**: Manually modify the text before accepting
> - **Discard**: Starts over
>
> I like this content, but let's say I want it a bit shorter. I'll click the Refine button.
>
> [SCREEN: Click Refine]
>
> Now I see refinement options: Make Shorter, Make Longer, Simplify Language, Add Examples, and Change Tone. I'll click "Make Shorter."
>
> [SCREEN: Click "Make Shorter", show loading]
>
> In just 3 seconds, the AI has condensed the content while keeping the key points. Much better! Now I'll click Accept to insert it into my text block.
>
> [SCREEN: Click Accept, show content in editor]

**[04:30-05:30] Understanding Course Context**

> One of the most powerful features of the AI Assistant is that it understands your course context. Let me show you what I mean.
>
> [SCREEN: Open AI Assistant again]
>
> When I generate content, the AI automatically knows:
> - The course title: "Introduction to React"
> - The module name: "React Fundamentals"
> - The lesson name: "Understanding Hooks"
> - Any learning objectives I've defined
>
> This means the AI generates content that fits naturally into your course structure. It maintains consistent terminology, references previous concepts when appropriate, and aligns with your learning objectives.
>
> Let me demonstrate. I'll ask it to "Explain useState hook, building on the introduction we just created."
>
> [SCREEN: Type prompt and generate]
>
> Notice how the generated content references the introduction and maintains the same tone and style. That's context awareness in action!

**[05:30-06:30] Using Templates**

> To make generation even faster, you can use templates. Templates are pre-configured prompts for common scenarios.
>
> [SCREEN: Click template dropdown]
>
> See all these options? Lesson Introduction, Concept Explanation, Practice Activity, and more. Let's try the "Lesson Summary" template.
>
> [SCREEN: Select "Lesson Summary"]
>
> The prompt field automatically fills with a structured prompt. I just need to customize it slightly—I'll add "React hooks" as the topic.
>
> [SCREEN: Edit prompt, generate]
>
> And just like that, I have a professional lesson summary. Templates save you time and ensure consistency across your course.

**[06:30-07:30] Generation History**

> One more feature before we wrap up: generation history. Click the History tab at the top of the AI Assistant panel.
>
> [SCREEN: Click History tab]
>
> Here you can see all your previous generations for this course. This is incredibly useful for:
> - Reusing content you generated earlier
> - Copying successful prompts
> - Maintaining consistency across lessons
>
> To reuse content, just click the "Reuse" button next to any entry, and it loads into your current block. You can also copy to clipboard or delete entries you no longer need.
>
> [SCREEN: Demonstrate reuse function]

**[07:30-08:00] Wrap Up**

> And that's it! You've learned how to:
> - Access the AI Assistant
> - Generate your first content
> - Refine and edit generated content
> - Use templates for faster creation
> - Access your generation history
>
> In the next tutorial, we'll explore AI capabilities for different block types—code examples, quiz questions, video scripts, and more.
>
> Thanks for watching, and happy course creating!

## Tutorial 2: Block-Specific AI Features

**Duration**: 12 minutes
**Target Audience**: Admin users familiar with basics
**Prerequisites**: Completed Tutorial 1

### Script

**[00:00-00:30] Introduction**

> Welcome back! In this tutorial, we'll explore how the AI Content Assistant works with different block types. Each block type has specialized AI capabilities designed for its specific purpose.
>
> We'll cover text blocks, code blocks, video blocks, quiz blocks, and more. Let's get started!

**[00:30-02:00] Text Blocks - Deep Dive**

> We've already seen basic text generation, but text blocks support multiple content types. Let me show you.
>
> [SCREEN: Open text block, open AI Assistant]
>
> When generating for text blocks, you can specify the content type in your prompt:
> - Explanations: "Explain the concept of..."
> - Instructions: "Write step-by-step instructions for..."
> - Summaries: "Summarize the key points of..."
> - Examples: "Provide examples of..."
>
> Let's generate instructions. I'll type: "Write step-by-step instructions for setting up a React development environment."
>
> [SCREEN: Type and generate]
>
> Perfect! The AI has created a numbered list with clear, actionable steps. Notice how it includes:
> - Prerequisites
> - Detailed steps
> - Verification steps
> - Troubleshooting tips
>
> This is much faster than writing from scratch!

**[02:00-04:00] Code Blocks - Examples with Explanations**

> Now let's look at code blocks. Code generation is one of the most powerful features.
>
> [SCREEN: Add code block, open AI Assistant]
>
> I'll ask it to "Generate a React component that fetches data from an API using hooks, with error handling and loading states."
>
> [SCREEN: Type prompt and generate]
>
> Wow! Look at what we got:
> - Working React code with proper syntax
> - Inline comments explaining each section
> - Error handling and loading states as requested
> - A text explanation below the code
>
> [SCREEN: Scroll through code and explanation]
>
> The language is automatically detected as JavaScript/React. The code follows best practices and includes proper error handling. This is production-quality example code!
>
> One tip: Always specify the programming language and any specific patterns you want. For example, "using async/await" or "with TypeScript types."

**[04:00-05:30] Video Blocks - Script Generation**

> Video blocks have a unique AI capability: script generation with timestamps.
>
> [SCREEN: Add video block, open AI Assistant]
>
> I'll click "Generate Script" and enter: "Create a 5-minute video script explaining the useEffect hook in React."
>
> [SCREEN: Generate]
>
> Excellent! The AI has created:
> - An engaging video title
> - A concise description
> - A complete script with timestamps
> - Section breakdowns (intro, main content, conclusion)
> - Key points to emphasize
>
> [SCREEN: Show script structure]
>
> This script is ready to use for recording. The timestamps help you pace your video, and the structure ensures you cover all important points. You can use this as-is or customize it to match your presentation style.

**[05:30-07:00] Quiz Blocks - Question Generation**

> Creating quiz questions can be time-consuming. Let's see how AI helps.
>
> [SCREEN: Add interactive block, select Final Assessment type]
>
> I'll ask for: "Generate 5 multiple choice questions about React hooks at the application level."
>
> [SCREEN: Generate]
>
> Look at this! We have:
> - 5 well-crafted questions
> - 4 options each with one correct answer
> - Distractors based on common misconceptions
> - Explanations for each correct answer
> - Bloom's taxonomy level indicated
>
> [SCREEN: Review questions]
>
> Notice how the distractors are plausible but clearly wrong if you understand the concept. This is exactly what good assessment questions should do. You can edit individual questions or regenerate specific ones if needed.

**[07:00-08:30] Reflection Blocks - Thought-Provoking Prompts**

> Reflection blocks help learners think critically. The AI generates multiple prompt options.
>
> [SCREEN: Add reflection block, open AI Assistant]
>
> I'll request: "Generate reflection prompts for a lesson on React hooks, focusing on real-world application."
>
> [SCREEN: Generate]
>
> Perfect! We have 5 different prompt options:
> - Open-ended questions
> - Scenario-based prompts
> - Comparative prompts
> - Application prompts
>
> [SCREEN: Show different prompts]
>
> Each prompt encourages different types of thinking. I can select the one that best fits my learning objectives. The AI even suggests minimum response lengths for each prompt.

**[08:30-09:30] Poll Blocks - Engagement Questions**

> Polls are great for engagement and formative assessment. Let's generate one.
>
> [SCREEN: Add poll block, open AI Assistant]
>
> I'll ask: "Create a poll about preferred methods for managing state in React."
>
> [SCREEN: Generate]
>
> Great! We have:
> - A clear, concise question
> - 4 balanced options (useState, useReducer, Context API, External library)
> - Follow-up discussion questions
>
> [SCREEN: Show poll]
>
> The options are mutually exclusive and cover the main approaches. The follow-up questions help facilitate discussion after learners vote. This is perfect for engaging learners and checking understanding.

**[09:30-10:30] List Blocks - Structured Content**

> List blocks are perfect for steps, tips, requirements, and checklists.
>
> [SCREEN: Add list block, open AI Assistant]
>
> I'll generate: "List 10 best practices for writing React components."
>
> [SCREEN: Generate]
>
> Excellent! We have a well-organized list of best practices. The AI automatically:
> - Chose an unordered list (since order doesn't matter)
> - Provided concise but informative items
> - Covered a range of important practices
>
> [SCREEN: Show list]
>
> If I wanted steps instead, I could ask for "steps to deploy a React app" and it would generate a numbered list. The AI understands when order matters.

**[10:30-11:30] Image Blocks - Alt Text Generation**

> Accessibility is crucial. The AI helps generate alt text for images.
>
> [SCREEN: Add image block, upload an image]
>
> After uploading an image—let's say a React component diagram—I'll click "Generate Alt Text."
>
> [SCREEN: Click generate]
>
> The AI analyzes the image context (surrounding text, lesson topic) and generates:
> - Concise alt text under 125 characters
> - An extended caption with educational context
>
> [SCREEN: Show generated alt text and caption]
>
> This ensures your course is accessible to all learners, including those using screen readers. The AI follows WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines automatically.

**[11:30-12:00] Wrap Up**

> We've covered a lot! You now know how to use AI for:
> - Text explanations and instructions
> - Code examples with comments
> - Video scripts with timestamps
> - Quiz questions with explanations
> - Reflection prompts
> - Polls and engagement activities
> - Structured lists
> - Image alt text
>
> In the next tutorial, we'll dive into templates and customization. See you there!

**Duration**: 10 minutes
**Target Audience**: Admin users ready to optimize workflow
**Prerequisites**: Completed Tutorials 1-2

### Script

**[00:00-00:30] Introduction**

> Welcome to Tutorial 3! Now that you're comfortable with basic generation, let's explore templates and customization. These features will make you even more efficient and help maintain consistency across your courses.

**[00:30-02:00] Understanding Templates**

> Templates are pre-configured prompts for common scenarios. Think of them as shortcuts that encode best practices.
>
> [SCREEN: Open AI Assistant, click template dropdown]
>
> We have several built-in templates:
> - Lesson Introduction
> - Learning Objectives
> - Concept Explanation
> - Lesson Summary
> - Practice Activity
> - Knowledge Check
> - Case Study
> - Troubleshooting Guide
>
> Each template is optimized for specific purposes and includes variables that get automatically filled with your course context.

**[02:00-03:30] Using Built-in Templates**

> Let's use the "Learning Objectives" template.
>
> [SCREEN: Select "Learning Objectives" template]
>
> Notice how the prompt field fills automatically. It includes placeholders like {topic} and {courseTitle}. The course title is filled automatically, but I need to specify the topic.
>
> [SCREEN: Edit {topic} to "React Hooks"]
>
> I can also adjust the Bloom's taxonomy level. Let's set it to "Application" since we want learners to use hooks, not just understand them.
>
> [SCREEN: Generate]
>
> Perfect! We have 4 well-crafted learning objectives that:
> - Start with action verbs
> - Are specific and measurable
> - Align with the application level
> - Include assessment methods
>
> [SCREEN: Review objectives]
>
> This would have taken 15-20 minutes to write manually. With the template, it took 30 seconds!


**[03:30-05:30] Creating Custom Templates**

> Now let's create a custom template. Navigate to the Admin Dashboard and click "AI Settings."
>
> [SCREEN: Navigate to AI Settings → Custom Templates]
>
> Click "Create New Template." I'll create a template for API documentation since I teach a lot of backend development.
>
> [SCREEN: Click "Create New Template"]
>
> First, I'll fill in the basics:
> - Name: "API Endpoint Documentation"
> - Description: "Generates comprehensive API endpoint docs"
> - Category: Reference
> - Block Types: Text Block, Code Block
>
> [SCREEN: Fill in fields]
>
> Now for the template prompt. I'll write:
>
> ```
> Create detailed API documentation for the {endpointName} endpoint in {apiName}.
>
> Include:
> 1. Endpoint URL and HTTP method
> 2. Purpose and use case
> 3. Request parameters
> 4. Request example in {language}
> 5. Response format
> 6. Response examples (success and error)
> 7. Authentication requirements
> 8. Common errors
>
> Format: Technical documentation
> Reading Level: Professional
> ```
>
> [SCREEN: Type template prompt]
>
> Now I'll define the variables:
> - {endpointName}: Required, text input
> - {apiName}: Required, text input
> - {language}: Optional, dropdown (JavaScript, Python, cURL)
>
> [SCREEN: Define variables]
>
> I'll set default options:
> - Tone: Formal
> - Reading Level: Professional
> - Length: Detailed
>
> [SCREEN: Set defaults]
>
> Now I'll save the template. Let's test it!
>
> [SCREEN: Save, then open a text block and select the new template]
>
> I'll fill in:
> - endpointName: "Create User"
> - apiName: "User Management API"
> - language: "Python"
>
> [SCREEN: Fill variables and generate]
>
> Excellent! We have comprehensive API documentation with all the sections I specified. This template will save me hours on every API course I create.

**[05:30-07:00] Template Variables Explained**

> Let's talk about variables in more detail. There are two types:
>
> **Built-in Variables** (automatically available):
> - {courseTitle}
> - {moduleName}
> - {lessonName}
> - {learningObjectives}
> - {tone}
> - {readingLevel}
> - {length}
>
> [SCREEN: Show list]
>
> **Custom Variables** (you define):
> - Text inputs: {topic}, {description}
> - Dropdowns: {difficulty}, {language}
> - Numbers: {duration}, {questionCount}
> - Booleans: {includeExamples}
>
> [SCREEN: Show examples]
>
> When designing templates, use variables to make them flexible. But don't overdo it—too many variables make templates cumbersome. Aim for 3-5 custom variables maximum.

**[07:00-08:30] Sharing Templates**

> Once you've created great templates, you can share them with your team.
>
> [SCREEN: Go to template library]
>
> Click the export button next to any custom template. You can export as JSON or Markdown.
>
> [SCREEN: Click export, show options]
>
> I'll export as JSON. This creates a file I can share via email, Slack, or your team's shared drive.
>
> [SCREEN: Save file]
>
> To import a template, click "Import Template" and select the JSON file. The template is added to your library instantly.
>
> [SCREEN: Demonstrate import]
>
> This is perfect for:
> - Sharing best practices across your team

## Tutorial 4: Content Refinement Mastery

**Duration**: 7 minutes
**Target Audience**: All admin users
**Prerequisites**: Basic familiarity with generation

### Script

**[00:00-00:30] Introduction**

> Welcome! In this tutorial, we'll master content refinement—the art of improving AI-generated content without starting over. Refinement is faster than regeneration and helps you iterate toward perfect content.

**[00:30-01:30] When to Refine vs Regenerate**

> First, let's understand when to use each approach.
>
> **Use Refinement when:**
> - The content is mostly good but needs tweaking
> - You want to adjust length or complexity
> - You need to add examples or change tone
> - You want to preserve the core message
>
> **Use Regeneration when:**
> - The content is completely off-topic
> - You want a fresh perspective
> - You've changed your prompt significantly
> - Multiple refinements haven't worked
>
> [SCREEN: Show comparison graphic]
>
> Refinement is like editing a draft. Regeneration is like starting with a blank page.

**[01:30-03:00] The Five Refinement Options**

> Let's explore each refinement option. I'll generate some content first.
>
> [SCREEN: Generate text about React hooks]
>
> Now I'll click Refine to see our options:
>
> **1. Make Shorter**
> Reduces length by 30-50% while keeping key points.
>
> [SCREEN: Click "Make Shorter", show result]
>
> See how it condensed the content but kept the essential information? Perfect for when you're over your word limit.
>
> **2. Make Longer**
> Expands content with more details and examples.
>
> [SCREEN: Click "Make Longer", show result]
>
> Now we have more depth, additional examples, and fuller explanations. Great for when content feels too brief.
>
> **3. Simplify Language**
> Lowers reading level and uses simpler vocabulary.
>
> [SCREEN: Click "Simplify Language", show result]
>
> Notice how technical terms are explained and sentences are shorter. Perfect for beginner audiences.
>
> **4. Add Examples**
> Includes 1-3 concrete examples.
>
> [SCREEN: Click "Add Examples", show result]
>
> Now we have practical examples that make abstract concepts concrete. This helps learners understand better.
>
> **5. Change Tone**
> Adjusts formality and style.
>
> [SCREEN: Click "Change Tone", select "Encouraging", show result]
>
> The content now has a more supportive, motivational tone. Great for challenging topics where learners need encouragement.

**[03:00-04:30] Sequential Refinement**

> Here's a powerful technique: applying multiple refinements in sequence.
>
> [SCREEN: Generate new content]
>
> Let's say I generate an explanation of useEffect. It's good, but I want to improve it step by step.
>
> **Step 1:** Add Examples
> [SCREEN: Refine → Add Examples]
>
> Now we have concrete examples. But they're a bit complex.
>
> **Step 2:** Simplify Language
> [SCREEN: Refine → Simplify Language]
>
> Perfect! Now we have examples that are easy to understand.
>
> **Step 3:** Make Shorter
> [SCREEN: Refine → Make Shorter]
>
> And now it's concise without losing clarity. This is the power of sequential refinement—you can sculpt content exactly how you want it.

**[04:30-05:30] Refinement Best Practices**

> Here are some tips for effective refinement:
>
> **Tip 1: Start with good generation**
> The better your initial prompt, the less refinement you'll need.
>
> **Tip 2: One refinement at a time**
> See the effect of each change before applying the next.
>
> **Tip 3: Know when to regenerate**
> If you've refined 3+ times and still aren't happy, regenerate with a better prompt.
>
> **Tip 4: Use refinement for minor adjustments**
> Major changes are better handled by regenerating with a modified prompt.
>
> **Tip 5: Accept before manual editing**
> Once you're happy with refinements, accept the content, then make final manual edits.

**[05:30-06:30] Comparing Versions**

> Sometimes you want to compare different versions. Here's a workflow:
>
> [SCREEN: Generate content]
>
> 1. Generate initial content
> 2. Copy to clipboard (for backup)
> 3. Apply refinement
> 4. Compare with original
> 5. Choose the better version
>
> [SCREEN: Demonstrate workflow]
>
> You can also use the history panel to access previous versions. This is helpful when you've refined multiple times and want to go back to an earlier version.
>
> [SCREEN: Show history panel]

**[06:30-07:00] Wrap Up**

> Excellent! You now know:
> - When to refine vs regenerate
> - How to use all five refinement options
> - Sequential refinement techniques
> - Best practices for effective refinement
> - How to compare versions
>
> Refinement is a powerful tool that will save you time and help you create exactly the content you need. Practice with it, and it will become second nature!

## Tutorial 5: Lesson Outline Generation

**Duration**: 9 minutes
**Target Audience**: Admin users creating new lessons
**Prerequisites**: Completed Tutorial 1

### Script

**[00:00-00:30] Introduction**

> Welcome! In this tutorial, we'll explore one of the most powerful features: lesson outline generation. This feature lets you create complete lesson structures with multiple blocks in one go. It's perfect for quickly scaffolding new lessons.

**[00:30-01:30] When to Use Outline Generation**

> Lesson outline generation is ideal when:
> - Starting a new lesson from scratch
> - You know the topic but not the structure
> - You want to maintain consistent lesson flow
> - You need to create multiple similar lessons
> - You're experiencing writer's block
>
> [SCREEN: Show empty lesson canvas]
>
> It's not ideal when:
> - You have a very specific structure in mind
> - The lesson is highly specialized or unique
> - You prefer to build lessons block by block
>
> Most instructors use outline generation for 60-70% of their lessons, then customize from there.

**[01:30-03:30] Generating Your First Outline**

> Let's create a lesson outline. I'm in an empty lesson called "Advanced React Patterns."
>
> [SCREEN: Show empty lesson]
>
> I'll click "Generate Lesson Outline" in the toolbar.
>
> [SCREEN: Click button, modal opens]
>
> Now I need to provide:
>
> **Topic:** "Advanced React Patterns including Render Props, Higher-Order Components, and Compound Components"
>
> [SCREEN: Type topic]
>
> **Learning Objectives:** I'll add 3-4 objectives:
> - Understand when to use advanced patterns
> - Implement render props pattern
> - Create higher-order components
> - Build compound components
>
> [SCREEN: Type objectives]
>
> **Block Count:** I'll keep the default of 10 blocks. This gives us a comprehensive lesson without being overwhelming.
>
> [SCREEN: Show block count slider]
>
> Now I'll click "Generate Outline" and wait about 10-15 seconds.
>
> [SCREEN: Click generate, show loading]
>
> And here's our outline!

**[03:30-05:30] Reviewing the Generated Outline**

> Let's look at what the AI created:
>
> [SCREEN: Scroll through outline]
>
> 1. **Text Block**: "Introduction to Advanced React Patterns" (5 min)
> 2. **Text Block**: "When to Use Advanced Patterns" (7 min)
> 3. **Code Block**: "Render Props Example" (10 min)
> 4. **Text Block**: "Understanding Render Props" (8 min)
> 5. **Code Block**: "Higher-Order Components Example" (10 min)
> 6. **Reflection Block**: "Comparing Patterns" (5 min)
> 7. **Code Block**: "Compound Components Example" (12 min)
> 8. **Interactive Block**: "Pattern Recognition Quiz" (10 min)
> 9. **List Block**: "Best Practices" (5 min)
> 10. **Text Block**: "Lesson Summary" (3 min)
>
> Notice how the AI:
> - Created a logical flow from introduction to summary
> - Alternated between explanation and practice
> - Included different block types for variety
> - Estimated time for each block
> - Aligned with our learning objectives
>
> This is a solid structure! But we can customize it.

**[05:30-07:00] Customizing the Outline**

> Before accepting blocks, we can customize the outline.
>
> **Reordering Blocks:**
> Let's say I want the reflection block after all the code examples. I'll drag it down.
>
> [SCREEN: Drag reflection block to new position]
>
> **Accepting/Rejecting Blocks:**
> Maybe I don't need the "When to Use" text block. I'll uncheck it.

>
> **Tip 3:** Review the flow before accepting. Ensure logical progression.
>
> **Tip 4:** Don't be afraid to customize. The outline is a starting point, not a final product.
>
> **Tip 5:** Use outline generation for consistency. Generate outlines for similar lessons to maintain structure.

**[08:30-09:00] Wrap Up**

> Fantastic! You now know how to:
> - Generate complete lesson outlines

**[02:00-04:00] Advanced Prompting Techniques**

> Let's explore advanced prompting strategies.
>
> **Technique 1: Layered Context**
> Instead of: "Explain React hooks"
> Try: "Explain React hooks for students who understand JavaScript closures but are new to React, in the context of a lesson on state management"
>
> [SCREEN: Show comparison]
>
> **Technique 2: Format Specification**
> Instead of: "List best practices"
> Try: "Create a numbered list of 7 best practices for React performance, with each item including a brief explanation and a code example"
>
> [SCREEN: Show comparison]
>
> **Technique 3: Constraint Setting**
> Instead of: "Write an introduction"
> Try: "Write a 150-word introduction that hooks learners with a real-world problem, introduces the solution, and previews 3 key concepts"
>
> [SCREEN: Show comparison]
>
> **Technique 4: Example-Driven**
> "Generate quiz questions similar to this example: [paste example]. Focus on application-level understanding."
>
> [SCREEN: Show example]
>
> The more specific and structured your prompts, the better your results.

**[04:00-06:00] Batch Content Creation**

> Here's a workflow for creating multiple similar pieces of content efficiently.
>
> **Scenario:** I need to create 5 lessons on different React hooks.
>
> **Step 1:** Create a custom template
> [SCREEN: Create template for "Hook Explanation Lesson"]
>
> **Step 2:** Generate outline for first lesson
> [SCREEN: Generate outline for useState]
>
> **Step 3:** Refine and perfect the first lesson
> [SCREEN: Work through blocks]
>
> **Step 4:** Export the template with refined prompts
> [SCREEN: Save successful prompts]
>
> **Step 5:** Use template for remaining lessons
> [SCREEN: Generate useEffect, useContext, useReducer, useMemo lessons]
>
> This approach ensures consistency while saving massive amounts of time. I can create 5 lessons in the time it used to take to create 1!

**[06:00-08:00] Cache Optimization**

> Understanding and optimizing cache usage can significantly reduce costs.
>
> [SCREEN: Open AI Usage Dashboard]
>
> **Current cache hit rate:** Let's say it's 25%. We can improve this.
>
> **Strategy 1: Reuse Successful Prompts**
> When you find a prompt that works well, save it as a template. Using the same prompt retrieves cached content.
>
> **Strategy 2: Standardize Common Content**
> For content you use repeatedly (lesson intros, summaries), use templates with consistent prompts.
>
> **Strategy 3: Check History First**
> Before generating, check if you've created similar content before.
>
> [SCREEN: Show history panel]
>
> **Strategy 4: Batch Similar Generations**
> Generate similar content in one session to maximize cache hits.
>
> [SCREEN: Demonstrate]
>
> With these strategies, you can achieve 50-60% cache hit rates, cutting costs in half!

**[08:00-10:00] Cross-Course Consistency**

> Maintaining consistency across multiple courses is challenging. Here's how AI helps.
>
> **Technique 1: Course-Specific Templates**
> Create templates that encode your course style.
>
> [SCREEN: Show template with style guidelines]
>
> **Technique 2: Terminology Management**
> Include a glossary in your prompts:
> "Use these terms consistently: [list terms and definitions]"
>
> [SCREEN: Show example]
>
> **Technique 3: Style Guide Integration**
> Create a master template that includes your style guide:
> - Tone preferences
> - Formatting standards
> - Example structures
> - Terminology
>
> [SCREEN: Show style guide template]
>
> **Technique 4: Template Library Organization**
> Organize templates by:
> - Course type (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
> - Subject area (programming, design, business)
> - Content type (tutorial, reference, practice)
>
> [SCREEN: Show organized template library]

**[10:00-12:00] Quality Control Workflow**

> Here's a systematic approach to ensuring quality:
>
> **Step 1: Generate**
> Use specific prompts and appropriate templates.
>
> **Step 2: Quick Review**
> Scan for obvious errors or off-topic content.
> - If good: proceed to Step 3
> - If poor: regenerate with better prompt
>
> **Step 3: Refine**
> Apply 1-2 refinements to optimize.
>
> **Step 4: Fact-Check**
> Verify technical details, code examples, and facts.
> [SCREEN: Show fact-checking process]
